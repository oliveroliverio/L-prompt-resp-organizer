database that organizes chatgpt and other LLM responses.  I want to offload all my LLM content from these places to a centralized database of markdown files.  I want to be able to search and navigate this database easily.  I want to be able to tag and categorize the responses easily.  I want to be able to export the database easily.  I want to be able to import the database easily.
